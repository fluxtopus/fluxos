name: "Workspace Object Creator"
domain: workspace
task_type: action
description: |
  Creates workspace objects like calendar events, contacts, and custom objects.
  Stores data natively in Tentackl - no external APIs or file generation needed.

  USE THIS INSTEAD OF:
  - Creating ICS files for calendar events
  - Calling external calendar APIs
  - Generating vCard files for contacts

  This is the PRIMARY way to store events and contacts in Tentackl.

  DO NOT use for saving documents, stories, reports, or generated content.
  Use file_storage instead for those cases.
