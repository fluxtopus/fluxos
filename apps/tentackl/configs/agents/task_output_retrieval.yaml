agent_type: task_output_retrieval
name: "Task Output Retrieval"
domain: task
task_type: retrieval
description: |
  Retrieves step outputs from a previously executed task.
  Use when the current task needs data produced by another task
  (files, analysis results, structured data).

  USE THIS when referencing outputs from a previous task by ID.
  DO NOT USE for workspace objects (use workspace_query),
  memories (use memory_query), or intra-task references
  (use {{step_X.outputs.field}} templates).

inputs:
  task_id:
    type: string
    required: true
    description: "UUID of the task to retrieve outputs from. This is the task ID that produced the data you need."
  step_id:
    type: string
    required: false
    description: "Specific step ID within the target task. Use when you know the exact step that produced the output."
  step_name:
    type: string
    required: false
    description: "Specific step name within the target task. Alternative to step_id when you know the step name but not ID."

outputs:
  task_id:
    type: string
    description: "The target task ID"

  steps:
    type: array
    description: "Array of steps with step_id, step_name, agent_type, status, outputs (only in all-steps mode)"
  step_count:
    type: integer
    description: "Number of steps returned (only in all-steps mode)"
  step_id:
    type: string
    description: "The specific step ID (only in single-step mode)"
  step_name:
    type: string
    description: "The specific step name (only in single-step mode)"
  agent_type:
    type: string
    description: "The agent type of the specific step (only in single-step mode)"
  status:
    type: string
    description: "Status of the specific step (only in single-step mode)"
  outputs:
    type: object
    description: "The step outputs containing the actual data (only in single-step mode)"
